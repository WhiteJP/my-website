# About me

I'm a Cognitive & Data Scientist who recently finished his Honours in Psychology at the
University of Melbourne. I am seeking to undertake PhD studies to fulfill my long standing life
ambition of joining the academy. Iâ€™m interested in using big data, computational
modeling/methods, and complex data analysis to better understand the mind, particularly in
relation to social, moral, legal, and political matters. I currently work as a Data/Cognitive
Scientist with Cogstate as well as tutor/TA at the University of Melbourne School of
Psychological Sciences. I have previously held numerous research assistant positions and,
prior to my career change to cognitive science, I was previously a litigation lawyer.  

Below is my visual resume made with the `VisualResume`
[package](https://github.com/ndphillips/VisualResume).

# About this website

This is my personal website, where I hope to keep an updated central point for 
all my activities: blogging, academic research and papers, software etc. 

This website is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using the beautiful 
and functional theme 'Loveit' developed by [Dillon](https://dillonzq.com/) (based 
on the earlier [LeaveIt](https://github.com/liuzc/LeaveIt) and 
[KeepIt](https://github.com/Fastbyte01/KeepIt) Hugo themes). For easy support
for R markdown, we also use [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)
